# 🔍 Divorce Prediction in Indian Marriages

Proud to share my latest machine learning project: **Divorce Prediction in Indian Marriages** 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🔍
💡Why this matters: Divorce prediction isn't just a technical task — it's an exploration of human factors like communication, social support, and emotional compatibility.
  This project blends domain relevance with ML best practices.


## 📌 Overview
This classification project predicts the likelihood of divorce based on synthetic yet socially realistic data from Indian households. 
It incorporates behavioral, relational, cultural, and lifestyle features to understand what contributes to marital outcomes.

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict divorce (binary: Yes/No) using clean and well-engineered features
- Evaluate multiple classifiers for performance
- Tune hyperparameters (XGBoost) for model optimization
- Share insights that are technically rigorous and socially interpretable


## 📊 Techniques
- Data cleaning, outlier detection, class distribution
- Label encoding for categorical variables
- Model comparison: 12 ML algorithms
- Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

## 🚀 Models Evaluated
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Extra Trees
- XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
- MLP (Neural Net), Ridge, KNN, Naive Bayes

## 📈 Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix
